# Sales_Customer_Performance_Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes market performance across four key Latin American countries: Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico.

The analysis focuses on understanding customer demographics, product performance, and sales trends across a three-year period (2020–2022). The goal is to transform raw business data into a clear and interactive dashboard that supports data-driven decision-making.

## Project Objectives

- Provide a high-level overview of business performance using key KPIs
- Analyze customer demographics by age group, gender, income group, and country
- Identify top-performing and underperforming products
- Understand sales distribution across regions
- Track sales trends over time (yearly, quarterly, monthly)
- Enable detailed product-level analysis through drill-through functionality

## Data Model

The analysis uses a star schema structure:

Sales (Fact Table) → Date (Dimension)
Sales (Fact Table) → Customer (Dimension)

A date table was created to support time-based analysis including Year, Quarter, and Month.
